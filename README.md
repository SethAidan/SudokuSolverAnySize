# Sudoku Solver

A simple Python program that solves Sudoku puzzles with varying grid sizesâ€”so long as the height and width are both the same square number. The solver uses logical deduction to determine an appropriate solution to the puzzle.

## Features
- User-friendly input validation for grid size and puzzle entries.
- Supports variable-sized Sudoku puzzles (4x4, 9x9, 16x16, etc.).
- Implements logical techniques to solve the puzzle without brute-force backtracking.

## How It Works
1. The user enters the size of the Sudoku puzzle.
2. The user inputs the puzzle row by row, using `0` to indicate empty spaces.
3. The program determines possible values for each cell based on Sudoku rules using a combination of the following:
   - Finds the only place a number could fit in a specific row/column/square.
   - Finds the only number a specific cell can contain.
4. The solver iterates through logical elimination techniques until the puzzle is solved.
5. The completed Sudoku grid is displayed.

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
Check you have a valid version of Python 3 installed on your computer using:
```console
python --version
```
or
```console
python3 --version
```

If not install it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
### Running the Program
1. Clone this repository
```console
git clone https://github.com/SethAidan/SudokuSolverAnySize.git sudoku-solver
cd sudoku-solver
```
2. Run the script
```console
python sudoku_solver.py
```
or
```console
python3 sudoku_solver.py
```

### Example Input/Output

Input:
```console
Enter the number of columns in the sudoku puzzle: 9
Use 0 to indicate an empty space
Enter line 1: 5 3 0 0 7 0 0 0 0
Enter line 2: 6 0 0 1 9 5 0 0 0
...
```
Output:
```console
[5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2]
[6, 7, 2, 1, 9, 5, 3, 4, 8]
...
```
## Code Breakdown

 - `input_size()`: Ensures the user enters a valid Sudoku grid size.

 - `input_puzzle(size)`: Takes a valid Sudoku grid input from the user.

 - `check_box(grid, size, i, j)`: Determines possible values for an empty cell.

 - `check_row(grid, size, i, num)`: Finds possible placements of a number in a row.

 - `check_col(grid, size, j, num)`: Finds possible placements of a number in a column.

 - `check_square(grid, size, i, j, num)`: Finds possible placements of a number in a subgrid.

 - `solved(grid, size)`: Checks if the puzzle is completely solved.

 - `solver(grid, size)`: Iteratively solves the puzzle using logical techniques.

 - `main()`: Runs the entire program.
